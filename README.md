## Parentheses, Brackets & Curly Braces auto-closing for Inkdrop

This plugin is pretty simple but it adds a feature that I missed from other editors. It automatically closes parentheses, brackets and curly braces when you type the opening character, and place the cursor between them.
Simple as that.

## Install

```
ipm install auto-close-brackets
```
